In the end of last year (2017), the Ghanaian government released a digital addressing project called (GhanaPost)[https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Step-by-step-guide-How-to-register-on-Digital-Address-system-other-things-to-know-592296]. 

Basically, the idea was to give a unique adddress to every 5m x 5m area. The project was estimated approx [Ghc3,500,000!](https://www.pulse.com.gh/news/local/digital-addressing-system-ghana-post-blows-ghc3-5-million-on-publicity-to-market-digital-addressing-app-id7523041.html]). I researched and found out the contractor (Vokacom Ltd) uses Google Maps API to deal with this problem. 

My inner scientists tingled and here's my attempt to recreate the Ghc3,500,000 GhanaPost system...

*Results were encouraging, I managed to generate most of the address. The challenge was getting the last 4 digits which are uniquely assigned and I wasn't certain which algorithm to create to make that. This side-project was completely experimental*
